# Introduction
this repository of two whitebox transparent ML that analyze, clean, preprocess, model Data
# Projects overview
### project 1  
- sales_games_regression.ipynb: regression project analyze and predict sales from different features
- problem statement: A gaming company needs to predict which video games will be successful in the global market to optimize their development and marketing investments.The output is expected to be explained to a non-technical audience.

### project 2 
- credit_score.ipynb: analyze customer financial data to predict credit score level
- problem statement: A large global finance bank would like to improve the process of credit risk scoring their customers to eliminate employee biases, human error and standardize the process while improving efficiency.
